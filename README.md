# SportsStat: Advanced Data Pipeline for Sports Analytics

## Overview

SportsStat is a comprehensive data engineering solution designed to collect, process, and analyze sports-related data from various sources. This project aims to provide valuable insights to sports organizations, teams, and fans to enhance performance, optimize strategies, and improve the overall fan experience.

## Features

- Real-time ingestion of data from sports leagues, teams, and fan-generated sources
- Scalable data processing using Apache Spark
- Data transformation and orchestration with dbt
- Data warehouse storage using Snowflake for efficient querying and analysis
- ETL pipelines for data integration, enrichment, and modeling
- Machine learning models for player performance prediction, injury risk assessment, and fan engagement optimization
- Interactive data visualization dashboards using Tableau
- Automated data quality checks and monitoring
- CI/CD pipeline for data workflows

## Tech Stack

- Apache Spark: Large-scale data processing
- Apache Kafka: Real-time data streaming
- Snowflake: Cloud data warehouse
- dbt: Data transformation and orchestration
- Docker: Containerization
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration
- Python: Primary programming language
- Scala: For some Spark jobs
- Tableau: Data visualization
- MLflow: Machine learning lifecycle management
- Great Expectations: Data quality testing
- GitHub Actions: CI/CD

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Apache Spark
- Apache Kafka
- Snowflake
- dbt

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/sportsstat.git
   cd sportsstat
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Initialize the Snowflake data warehouse:
   ```
   docker-compose run dbt dbt deps
   docker-compose run dbt dbt run --models +schema
   ```

4. Start the dbt development server:
   ```
   docker-compose run dbt dbt build
   ```

5. Access the dbt web interface at `http://localhost:8080`

## Usage

1. Configure your sports data sources in `src/data/ingestion/`
2. Define your data transformation and modeling tasks in the dbt `models/` directory
3. Run your ETL pipelines using dbt commands:
   ```
   docker-compose run dbt dbt run
   ```
4. Monitor your data pipelines and models through the dbt web interface

## Data Quality Tests

We use Great Expectations for data quality testing. Test suites are located in the `tests/quality/` directory.

To run data quality tests:

1. Navigate to the project root
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   great_expectations checkpoint run my_checkpoint
   ```

This will execute the defined expectations against your data and generate a data quality report.

## CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`. They include:

- Automated testing on pull requests
- Data quality checks on scheduled intervals
- Deployment of updated dbt models and Spark jobs to production
